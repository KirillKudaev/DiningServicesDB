# DiningServicesDB

### The goal of the project is to design a database for the Principia College Dining Services that matches the following requirements:

### Version 1 Requirements
- User is created via logging in to the user’s Facebook profile
- Allow user to look up menu for any previous meal and for one week in advance
- User may look up the times the dining room or pub opens and closes
- User may check in to the dining room or pub
- User remains checked in until the user checks out or 1 hour has elapsed since the check in
- User can rate and comment about a certain dish

### Version 2 Requirements
- A user may rate the meal as a whole
- Rating categories are: quality of service, quality of food, and general cleanliness
- User can “follow” or be “followed” by other users
- Users can sign up to receive notifications for the following:
- When meal times begin and end for both the pub and dining room
- When grill is about to close in the pub
- When user’s favorite dishes are being served
- If someone the user is following has checked in at either the pub or dining room
- If a meal sponsor has checked in to either the pub or dining room
- User has the option to indicate that he or she can sponsor a meal
